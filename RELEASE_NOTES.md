## Version 1.1.0 - June 25, 2025

### üéÆ Interactive Keyboard Controls

- **Added comprehensive keyboard controls** for real-time slideshow interaction:
  - `SPACE` - Pause/Resume slideshow
  - `N` / `‚Üí` (Right Arrow) - Skip to next slide immediately
  - `S` - Save current slide (works even with `--no-save` mode)
  - `Q` - Quit slideshow gracefully
  - `Ctrl+C` - Force quit with cleanup
- **Implemented KeyboardHandler class** with raw terminal input mode for responsive key detection
- **Added signal handling** for graceful shutdown on SIGINT

### üé® Enhanced Image Display & Progress Bar

- **Improved image sizing logic**: Images always fit terminal height minus reserved lines for UI elements
- **Redesigned progress bar system**:
  - Single-line, stable progress bar that doesn't shift the image display
  - ASCII play/pause indicators: `‚ñ∂` for play, `‚è∏` for pause
  - Centered progress bar with proper terminal width calculation
  - No newlines that could disrupt image positioning
- **Reserved terminal lines** for progress bar and controls, ensuring image top border is always visible
- **Enhanced terminal clearing** on exit for clean shutdown
